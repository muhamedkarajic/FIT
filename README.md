### Faculty of Information Technologies, University "Džemal Bijedić"​ in Mostar.

#### First Semester:
This repositorie is designed to help students of the Faculty of Information Technologies to be productive with the exercises in C++. Not every exercise of C++ language is considered, instead, the repositorie is focused on some important practical-oriented features of the language. The language features discussed in this repositorie will be shown in action with concrete C++ code samples, that have been provided by FIT or have been found over the web. This repositorie is a mix of examples, exercises and C++ demos that I have done over my first semester. The repositorie starts from a simple Hello World program. Next, you will see how to represent data in your C++ programs with types and variables. Then, the exercises get harder and you will discover how to write code to make decisions and iterating. Finally, the exercises explore the basics of arrays from storing, manipulating and transpositing them.
