## Programming I

### Faculty of Information Technologies, University "Džemal Bijedić"​ in Mostar.

#### First and Second Semester:
This repositorie is designed to help students of the Faculty of Information Technologies to be productive with the exercises in C++. Not every exercise of C++ language is considered, instead, the repositorie is focused on some important practical-oriented features of the language. The language features discussed in this repositorie will be shown in action with concrete C++ code samples, that have been provided by FIT or have been found over the web. This repositorie is a mix of examples, exercises and C++ demos that I have done over my first and second semester. The repositorie starts from a simple Hello World and how to represent data in your C++ programs with types and variables over how to write code to make decisions and iterating. Finally, the exercises explore the basics of arrays from storing, manipulating and transpositing them.
